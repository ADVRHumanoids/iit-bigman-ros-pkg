HOW TO RUN A SIMULATION WITH MULTISENSE
=======================================

First of all checkout the branch "multisense_sim", goes in the build folder and make the package.

1. In two separate terminals run a yarpserver and a roscore. 
2. In a  third terminal run the command:
    ```
    gazeboros
    ```
    If the command is missing upload your walkman superbuild main folder.
3. Once gazebo is loaded drag and drop the IIT Bigman model.
4. In a fourth terminal goes in walkman/drc/iit-bigman-ros-pkg/bigman_gazebo/launch/ and run:
    ```
    roslaunch bigman_multisense.launch
    ```
Enjoy.
